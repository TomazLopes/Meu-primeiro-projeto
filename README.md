# My-first-projects
My first projects in Python!
The first of them is a simulation of a car game. I learned the basics from Mosh Hammedani's course and improved it on my own!
My second project was created from scratch, aiming to create an application capable of performing Pomodoros, allowing the user to choose the duration of study and rest times. For this project, I used the Playsound and Time modules.
